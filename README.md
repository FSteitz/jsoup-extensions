# jsoup-extensions
A small collection of Kotlin utility extensions for the jsoup API. The library currently only provides extensions for the type [Element](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/nodes/Element.html). Additional extensions might be added in the future. Pull requests are welcome.

## Building the library
`./gradlew build`
